Being dead is a notable disadvantage when it comes to fighting crime – or so you would think. After being shot and killed by a mystery assailant, detective Ronan O’Connor (that’d be you) decides to put his afterlife to good use by solving his own unfortunate murder. He does this with the aid of the spirit community, and his new found ability to possess (well, a bit) living beings. It’s pretty much Ghost, only with seemingly far fewer romantic pottery scenes.
