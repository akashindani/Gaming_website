The mod shifted thousands of copies of ARMA 2, and hundred of thousands have already been sold on Steam Early Access. DayZ is a phenomenon that’s only going to grow as the small team working on it at Bohemia fix the bugs and bring it up to completion. Each server supports a version of DayZ’s huge, zombie-infested and completely explorable island. 40 players at a time can fight for survival, scavenging clothes, medicine and weaponry from abandoned towns, gas stations, airports and military outposts. New players will quickly learn that humans are far more deadly than zombies. Well armed bandits will often hunt newbs on sight. Even in its early, clunky state, DayZ is extraordinarily tense, and keeps on turning out great stories.
