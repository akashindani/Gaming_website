The battle for air superiority had huge consequences for ground troops in the battle of Stalingrad. The latest in the veteran series of IL2 Sturmovik flight sims will include conflicts from Operation Uranus to the surrender of the 6th army. Gigabytes worth of flight manuals and historical accounts are being used to help model the feel of each plane, and veteran test pilots have given their feedback on the alpha version based on their real flying experiences. It claims to be the “largest and most detailed recreation of the Battle of Stalingrad theatre ever modeled in a flight simulation”. Players can buy into early access now, but the full release is due this year.
